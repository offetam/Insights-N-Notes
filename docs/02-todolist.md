# To-Do List 💡

:::note 
This is a list of immediate additions/changes I am looking to make. <br /> In addition, completed tasks will eventually be removed after a certain period of time, and added to the [legacy list instead](03-LEGACYtodolist.md)
:::

- [X] Build a homelab (for active directory to post on blog)
- [X] Finish adding all my notes on TryHackMe's Advent of Cyber (also add link here) 
    - [X] Add Day 8
    - [X] Add Days 9-14
    - [X] Add Remaining days (Days 16-24)
    - [ ] And proofread them [**In Progress**]
- [ ] Add TryHackMe free path
- [ ] Organize resources tab, including file naming (prioritize within folders) [**In Progress**]
- [ ] Organize sidebar labels to include titles (and not just the day) [**In Progress**]
- [ ] Add Advent of Cyber 2022 (and Cyber 2023)
- [ ] Start adding posts on blog (currently using template placeholders)
- [ ] Even more Proofread (Permanent in this to-do list 😅)
- [ ] Blog-wise, looking to share some hobby related upskilling (Blender)

## General Ideas 📐

:::tip 
A list of ideas worth potentially adding listed here!
:::

- [X] Add legacy to-do list of things ive completed? (and add ~~date~~ month it was completed too perhaps)
- [ ] Make blog more generic content?
- [ ] Start leveraging GIFs for some assets to demonstrate certain parts of the lab?
- [ ] For tryhackme advents (specifically 2022), make it more clear when the lab section starts
